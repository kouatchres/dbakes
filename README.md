# Complete Introduction to Fullstack, Type-Safe GraphQL (feat. Next.js, Nexus, Prisma)

In this post, you'll learn how to buildâ€“â€“from scratchâ€“â€“an entirely type-safe, fullstack web app, using GraphQL with a database attached!

To follow along with the source code, clone [this repo](https://github.com/hexrcs/fullstack-graphql-next-nexus-prisma).

> ðŸ—“ Update 19/11/2020: _The tutorial has been updated to use Nexus Schema as the Nexus Framework has been [discontinued](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-framework-experiment)_

## Our tech stack

First, let's have a look at our tools of choice:

- [**TypeScript**](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) - the programming language for both backend and frontend
- [**React**](https://reactjs.org/) and [**Next.js**](https://nextjs.org/) - as the frontend framework and [_middle-end_](https://medium.com/the-ideal-system/next-js-is-not-what-you-may-think-it-is-8423172e7401)
- [**Urql GraphQL client**](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/) - the GraphQL client on the frontend
- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/) - the database for the app
- [**Apollo Server**](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/) - the server framework we'll use to serve the GraphQL API
- [**Nexus Schema**](https://nexusjs.org/) - a library for building _code-first_ GraphQL APIs
- [**Prisma Client**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) and [**`prisma db push`**](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/command-reference/#db-push) - a toolkit to change the database schema, access, and query the database _(Note: `prisma db push` is still in a preview state at the moment)_

Let's get started! ðŸš€

## Step 0: Install VS Code extensions

Before we start, make sure that you have installed these VS Code extensions for syntax highlighting and auto-formatting - [Prisma](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma) and [GraphQL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.vscode-graphql).

## Step 1: Spin up a PostgreSQL database

The first thing you'll need is a PostgreSQL database instance to interact with during development.

There are many options for this, but Heroku allows us to host PostgreSQL databases for free with minimal setup required. Check out [this post](https://dev.to/prisma/how-to-setup-a-free-postgresql-database-on-heroku-1dc1) by [Nikolas Burk](https://dev.to/nikolasburk) guiding you through the process!

If you have Docker installed and would rather keep your development database local, you can also check out [this video](https://egghead.io/lessons/postgresql-set-up-and-run-a-postgresql-instance-locally-with-docker-compose?pl=build-a-full-stack-app-with-prisma-2-7c81) I did on how to do this with Docker Compose.

You will be able to get a PostgreSQL URI in this format:

```
postgresql://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST_NAME>:<PORT>/<DB_NAME>
```

> Note: if you are using Heroku, you'll get a URI with `postgres` instead of `postgresql` as the protocol. Both formats should work but we'd prefer to use `postgresql`.

When everything is set up properly, you're good to move on to the next step! ðŸ˜ƒ

## Step 2: Create a Next.js project

Now, create a Next.js project with `create-next-app` and enter the directory:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-awesome-app --use-npm -e with-typescript
cd my-awesome-app
```

Git should be automatically initialized by `create-next-app`, and your project structure should look like this:

![Project structure bootstrapped by `create-next-app`](https://i.imgur.com/kzVMkAY.png)<figcaption>Project structure bootstrapped by <code>create-next-app</code></figcaption>

> The `create-next-app` might not have the latest TypeScript package pre-installed. If you want to use the latest TypeScript features, run `npm install -D typescript@latest` after the project is bootstrapped.

## Step 3: Install Nexus with Prisma

With the Next.js project ready, open a terminal window at the root of the application and install both Nexus Schema and Prisma.

For Prisma, we need `@prisma/client`, `@nexus/schema` and `nexus-plugin-prisma` as a regular dependencies and `@prisma/cli` as a dev dependency.

Regular dependencies:

```bash
npm i @prisma/client @nexus/schema nexus-plugin-prisma
```

Dev dependencies:

```bash
npm i @prisma/cli
```

Once the dependencies are installed, initialize Prisma in the project.

```bash
npx prisma init
```

This command will create a `prisma` directory. If you have a look inside, you'll see a `.env` file and a `schema.prisma` file. The `schema.prisma` file will hold the database model and the `.env` file will hold the database connection string.

Because the database connection string contains sensitive information, it's a good practice to **never** commit this `.env` file with Git, so make sure it's also added to the `.gitignore` file.

Adjust the `schema.prisma` file to include a `User` model:

```prisma
datasource db {
  provider = "postgresql"
  url      = env("DATABASE_URL")
}

generator client {
  provider = "prisma-client-js"
}

model User {
  id   String @default(cuid()) @id
  name String
}
```

The schema file tells Prisma to use PostgreSQL as the database type, and the database connection URL is defined as an environment variable. It also defines a simple `User` data model with an `id` and a `name` field.

Your project should currently look like this:

![Project structure after creating the `prisma` directory](https://i.imgur.com/riZnypE.png)<figcaption>Project structure after creating the <code>prisma</code> directory</figcaption>

To improve the development experience, also add the [Nexus TypeScript Language Service plugin](https://www.nexusjs.org/#/guides/project-layout?id=typescript-language-service-plugin), and tweak a few compiler options in the `tsconfig.json` file like below:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "noEmit": true,
    "rootDir": ".",
    "typeRoots": ["node_modules/@types", "types"],
    "plugins": [{ "name": "nexus/typescript-language-service" }]
  },
  // ...
  "include": ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", ".", "types.d.ts"]
}
```

## Step 4: Wire up Nexus Schema with Next.js

Nexus Schema is a library that allows us to build code-first GraphQL APIs. It's our responsibility to bring along a server to serve that API. For our purposes, we'll use [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/).

There are several varieties of Apollo Server that are used for various purposes. For our project, we'll want `apollo-server-mirco` as it's well-suited to serverless deployments.

```bash
npm install apollo-server-micro
```

To create a GraphQL endpoint, create a new file in your project at `/pages/api/graphql.ts`. Thanks to the powerful [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) in Next.js, the GraphQL server will be accessible at [`http://our-app-domain/api/graphql`](http://our-app/api/graphql) when the Next.js server is started.

In the `/pages/api/graphql.ts` file, write the following boilerplate code:

```tsx
import { ApolloServer } from 'apollo-server-micro';

// we'll create these in a second!
import { schema } from '../../graphql/schema';
import { createContext } from './../../graphql/context';

const apolloServer = new ApolloServer({
  context: createContext,
  schema,
  tracing: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'
});

export const config = {
  api: {
    bodyParser: false
  }
};

export default apolloServer.createHandler({
  path: '/api/graphql'
});
```

Since everything inside the `/pages/api/` directory is considered as an API route, it's a good idea to implement the actual schema and resolvers outside this directory.

Now, create a new directory in the project root called `/graphql/` and two files within: `/graphql/schema.ts` and `/graphql/context.ts`.

Inside `/graphql/schema.ts`, start by using the `makeSchema` function to construct a GraphQL schema with Nexus. We'll also want to use `nexus-plugin-prisma` with the _CRUD_ feature enabled:

```ts
// graphql/schema.ts

import { objectType, queryType, mutationType, makeSchema } from '@nexus/schema';
import { nexusPrisma } from 'nexus-plugin-prisma';
import path from 'path';

const Query = queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.string('hello', { resolve: () => 'hello world' });
  }
});

export const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [Query],
  plugins: [nexusPrisma({ experimentalCRUD: true })],
  outputs: {
    typegen: path.join(process.cwd(), 'generated', 'nexus-typegen.ts'),
    schema: path.join(process.cwd(), 'generated', 'schema.graphql')
  },
  typegenAutoConfig: {
    contextType: 'Context.Context',
    sources: [
      {
        source: '@prisma/client',
        alias: 'prisma'
      },
      {
        source: path.join(process.cwd(), 'graphql', 'context.ts'),
        alias: 'Context'
      }
    ]
  }
});
```

The call to `makeSchema` includes a property called `plugins`. This is an array of any plugins we want to use with Nexus Schema and, in our case, we want to use `nexus-plugin-prisma`. The configuration we have here tells the plugin to use the CRUD feature which is what allows us to have automatically-generated CRUD resolvers for our API. You can [read more](https://nexusjs.org/docs/plugins/prisma/overview) on the CRUD feature provided by Nexus Schema.

Next, initialize the `PrismaClient` within `/graphql/context.ts` and export a function to create the context in Apollo Server.

```ts
// graphql/context.ts

import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';

const prisma = new PrismaClient();

export interface Context {
  prisma: PrismaClient;
}

export function createContext(): Context {
  return { prisma };
}
```

The file structure should now look something like this:

```bash
my-awesome-app/
â”œâ”€ components/
â”œâ”€ graphql/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ context.ts
â”‚  â”œâ”€ schema.ts
â”œâ”€ interfaces/
â”œâ”€ pages/
â”œâ”€ prisma/
â”‚  â”œâ”€ .env
â”‚  â”œâ”€ schema.prisma
â”œâ”€ utils/
â”œâ”€ next-env.d.ts
â”œâ”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€ package.json
â”œâ”€ tsconfig.json
```

With these files in place, run the application:

```bash
npx next dev
```

If you go to [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), you'll see the GraphQL Playground up and running (with our "hello world" schema)! ðŸ˜ƒ

![GraphQL Playground with a hello world schema](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/76awdex9a446jcazwz25.png)<figcaption>GraphQL Playground with a hello world schema</figcaption>

## Step 5: Implement your first GraphQL API

With the GraphQL server running in the background and the GraphQL Playground ready at [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), it's time to start implementing the API!

### Step 5.1: Define an Object type

Start by defining a `User` object type to reflect the database schema. Once defined, add it to the `types` array in `makeSchema`.

```ts
// graphql/schema.ts

import { objectType, queryType, makeSchema } from '@nexus/schema';

const User = objectType({
  name: 'User',
  definition(t) {
    t.model.id();
    t.model.name();
  }
});

// ...

export const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [User, Query]
  // ...
});
```

If you are typing the code above instead of copy n' pasting, you will notice that VS Code will autocomplete the fields (`id`, `name`) that are available on the `User` data model defined earlier in `/prisma/schema.prisma`.

> Tip: You can also always invoke intellisense with <kbd>CTRL + SPACE</kbd>, in case it doesn't automatically show up sometimes, super helpful!

Now, go back to the GraphQL Playground and toggle the _Schema_ side panel - you will see a GraphQL object type `User` is generated from the code you just wrote in the `/graphql/schema.ts` file.

```graphql
type User {
  id: String!
  name: String!
}
```

### Step 5.2: Define the Query type

For the root `Query` type, Nexus provides a `queryType` function.

To query a list of existing users in the database, you can write a resolver for `allUsers` field as follows:

```ts
const Query = queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.list.field('allUsers', {
      type: 'User',
      resolve(_parent, _args, ctx) {
        return ctx.prisma.user.findMany({});
      }
    });
  }
});
```

You can do whatever you want in the `resolve` function. The Prisma client for your database can be directly accessed as the `db` property on the `ctx` object. You can read more about the API of Prisma Client in its [official documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client/crud).

> Tip: You can always use the intellisense feature in VS Code to explore the APIs of Nexus and Prisma Client!

In addition to manually writing resolvers, the Nexus-Prisma plugin conveniently exposes basic "read" operations on the database on `t.crud`. The following code will let you find a `User` (or a list of _`User`s_) from the database directly.

```ts
const Query = queryType({
  definition(t) {
    t.list.field('allUsers', {
      type: 'User',
      resolve(_parent, _args, ctx) {
        return ctx.prisma.user.findMany({});
      }
    });
    t.crud.user();
    t.crud.users();
  }
});
```

The code above will generate a GraphQL root `Query` type:

```graphql
type Query {
  allUsers: [User!]
  user(where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
  users(
    skip: Int
    after: UserWhereUniqueInput
    before: UserWhereUniqueInput
    first: Int
    last: Int
  ): [User!]!
}

input UserWhereUniqueInput {
  id: String
}
```

Notice that all the related `Input` types are also generated for us for free! ðŸ’¯

![`Query` type is generated by Nexus](https://i.imgur.com/EXsOy3B.png)<figcaption><code>Query</code> type is generated by Nexus</figcaption>

### Step 5.3: Define the Mutation type

Similar to the `Query` type, a `Mutation` type can be defined with the `mutationType` function.

ðŸ˜ˆ Let's have some fun and create a `bigRedButton` mutation to destroy all user data in the database.

We also have access to the `t.crud` helper here, which exposes the basic "create", "update" and "delete" operations on the database. We then must add `Mutation` to the `types` array in `makeSchema`.

```ts
import { objectType, queryType, mutationType, makeSchema } from '@nexus/schema';

// ...

const Mutation = mutationType({
  definition(t) {
    t.field('bigRedButton', {
      type: 'String',
      async resolve(_parent, _args, ctx) {
        const { count } = await ctx.prisma.user.deleteMany({});
        return `${count} user(s) destroyed. Thanos will be proud.`;
      }
    });

    t.crud.createOneUser();
    t.crud.deleteOneUser();
    t.crud.deleteManyUser();
    t.crud.updateOneUser();
    t.crud.updateManyUser();
  }
});

// ...

export const schema = makeSchema({
  types: [User, Query, Mutation]
  // ...
});
```

This will generate a GraphQL schema like below:

```graphql
type Mutation {
  bigRedButton: String
  createOneUser(data: UserCreateInput!): User!
  deleteOneUser(where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
  deleteManyUser(where: UserWhereInput): BatchPayload!
  updateOneUser(data: UserUpdateInput!, where: UserWhereUniqueInput!): User
  updateManyUser(
    data: UserUpdateManyMutationInput!
    where: UserWhereInput
  ): BatchPayload!
}
```

![`Mutation` type is generated by Nexus](https://i.imgur.com/7mfLl68.png)<figcaption><code>Mutation</code> type is generated by Nexus</figcaption>

Now, our simple but fully-featured GraphQL API is ready! ðŸ¥³

## Step 6: Initialize the database

Before you can do anything with your GraphQL API, you'll need to create tables in the database corresponding to the Prisma schema file.

This can be done by manually connecting to the database and running SQL commands, but I'll show you how to do it with the `prisma db push` commnand - the database tool that's part of Prisma 2.

First, save the initial changes of our `schema.prisma` file with the command below. At the moment, the [`prisma db push` command](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/api-reference/command-reference/#db-push) is still in a preview state, so the extra flag `--preview-feature` flag is needed.

```bash
npx prisma db push --preview-feature
```

Awesome! With the database prepared, it's time to go back to [http://localhost:3000/api/graphql](http://localhost:3000/api/graphql), and have some fun with the your first GraphQL API with Nexus. Let me give you an example to play with!

```graphql
mutation {
  createOneUser(data: { name: "Alice" }) {
    id
  }
}
```

![Testing out user creation ðŸ˜Ž](https://i.imgur.com/160bZim.png)<figcaption>Testing out user creation ðŸ˜Ž</figcaption>

## Step 7: Set up Urql GraphQL client with Next.js

We'll use _[Urql](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/)_ as the GraphQL client on the frontend, but you can use any library you like.

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install graphql-tag next-urql react-is urql isomorphic-unfetch
```

Then, create a new file at `/pages/_app.tsx`. This is a [special Next.js component](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/custom-app) that will be used to initialize all pages.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { withUrqlClient, NextUrqlAppContext } from 'next-urql';
import NextApp, { AppProps } from 'next/app';
import fetch from 'isomorphic-unfetch';

// the URL to /api/graphql
const GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT = `http://localhost:3000/api/graphql`;

const App = ({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) => {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
};

App.getInitialProps = async (ctx: NextUrqlAppContext) => {
  const appProps = await NextApp.getInitialProps(ctx);
  return { ...appProps };
};

export default withUrqlClient((_ssrExchange, _ctx) => ({
  url: GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT,
  fetch
}))(
  // @ts-ignore
  App
);
```

And that's it! Now you can use the GraphQL client in any page in your Next.js app.

## Step 8: Use the GraphQL client

First, create a TSX file at `/components/AllUsers.tsx`. This file will have a component that performs an `allUsers` GraphQL query and renders the result as a list. This way, we can use the component to fetch all the user info from our PostgreSQL database.

You can create the query first, for example, with the following code. By using `gql`, the GraphQL VS Code extension will be able to identify the template string as a GraphQL query and apply nice syntax highlighting to it.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import gql from 'graphql-tag';
import { useQuery } from 'urql';

const AllUsersQuery = gql`
  query {
    allUsers {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;
```

Since it's known that the data you are going to get is an array of `User` objects (thank you, GraphQL schema!), you can also define a new type:

```tsx
type AllUsersData = {
  allUsers: {
    id: string;
    name: string;
  }[];
};
```

Next, create the React component that will be using the query.

The component encapsulates the following logic:

- If the query is still in a _fetching_ state, the text "Loading..." will be returned
- If an error is occurred during the process, we will display the error
- If the query is no longer _fetching_ and there's no error, the data will be used to render a list of users

```tsx
const AllUsers: React.FC = () => {
  const [result] = useQuery<AllUsersData>({
    query: AllUsersQuery
  });
  const { data, fetching, error } = result;

  if (fetching) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Oh no... {error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>There are {data?.allUsers.length} user(s) in the database:</p>
      <ul>
        {data?.allUsers.map(user => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AllUsers;
```

Now, save the TSX file, and mount it onto the home page `/pages/index.tsx`:

```tsx
import Link from 'next/link';
import Layout from '@/Layout';
import AllUsers from '@/AllUsers';

const IndexPage = () => (
  <Layout title="Home | Next.js + TypeScript Example">
    <h1>Hello Next.js ðŸ‘‹</h1>
    <p>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </p>
    {/* === Tada! === */}
    <AllUsers />
  </Layout>
);

export default IndexPage;
```

Time to spin up the Next.js dev server!

```bash
npm run dev
```

VoilÃ ! The user list is rendered! ðŸ¥³

![User list is rendered on our home page](https://i.imgur.com/l3XM26c.png)<figcaption>A user list is rendered on our home page</figcaption>

## Step 9: Auto-generate `useQuery` hooks and types

Instead of manually defining all the types we expect to receive via GraphQL, we can also use a very cool package _[GraphQL Code Generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/)_ to generate types directly from the Nexus GraphQL endpoint. This way, you essentially only have to define the types once in the `schema.prisma` file as the single-source-of-truth, then all types you'll use in the application can be derived from that schema with little manual effort! ðŸŽ‰

First, copy and refactor the GraphQL queries from the TSX files into the `graphql` directory. With the example from Step 8, create a new file at `/graphql/queries.graphql.ts` and copy the query from `/components/AllUsers.tsx`:

```tsx
import gql from 'graphql-tag';

export const AllUsersQuery = gql`
  query AllUsers {
    allUsers {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`;
```

_Separating GraphQL operations from components makes it easier to navigate the codebase._

Next, install the packages needed by `graphql-code-generator` as dev dependencies:

```bash
npm install -D \
    @graphql-codegen/cli \
    @graphql-codegen/typescript \
    @graphql-codegen/typescript-operations \
    @graphql-codegen/typescript-urql
```

Then, create a `codegen.yml` file in the project root with the following content:

```yaml
overwrite: true
schema: 'http://localhost:3000/api/graphql' # GraphQL endpoint via the nexus dev server
documents: 'graphql/**/*.graphql.ts' # parse graphql operations in matching files
generates:
  generated/graphql.tsx: # location for generated types, hooks and components
    plugins:
      - 'typescript'
      - 'typescript-operations'
      - 'typescript-urql'
    config:
      withComponent: false # we'll use Urql client with hooks instead
      withHooks: true
```

The configs above will tell `graphql-code-generator` to pull the GraphQL schema from `http://localhost:3000/api/graphql`, then generate types, Urql `useQuery` hooks into a file located at `/generated/graphql.tsx`.

Cool, let the code generation begin (in _watch_ mode)!

```yaml
npx graphql-codegen --watch
```

You will see some nice, written-by-a-robot code in `/generated/graphql.tsx`. How neat!

![A `useAllUsersQuery` hook and all the types are generated by GraphQL Code Generator](https://i.imgur.com/d7PCb0a.png)<figcaption>A <code>useAllUsersQuery</code> hook and all the types are generated by GraphQL Code Generator</figcaption>

Now, you can go back to `components/AllUsers.tsx`, and replace the manually written `AllUsersData` type, the GraphQL query, and the `useQuery` hook, with what's in the `/generated/graphql.tsx` file:

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { useAllUsersQuery } from '../../../generated/graphql';

const AllUsers: React.FC = () => {
  const [result] = useAllUsersQuery();
  const { data, fetching, error } = result;

  if (fetching) return <p>Loading...</p>;
  if (error) return <p>Oh no... {error.message}</p>;

  return (
    <div>
      <p>There are {data?.allUsers?.length} user(s) in the database:</p>
      <ul>
        {data?.allUsers?.map(user => (
          <li key={user.id}>{user.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
};

export default AllUsers;
```

Revisit the index page of the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), everything works like a charm! ðŸ™Œ

To make the development experience even better, let's optimize the NPM scripts for the project.

First, install the _[Concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently)_ NPM module, which is a great tool for running multiple CLI watchers at the same time:

```bash
npm install -D concurrently
```

Then, replace `dev` script in the `package.json` file with the following:

```json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ...
    "dev": "concurrently -r \"npx nexus dev\" \"npx next\" \"npx graphql-codegen --watch\""
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

Now, we can use a single `npm run dev` command to launch Nexus, Next.js, and GraphQL Code Generator, all at the same time!
